        <p>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>1970:</span> Diego joined Los Cebollitas, the children's
            division of Argentinos Juniors, where the legend began.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1976:</span> Diego played his first game as a professional.
          </li>
          <li><span>1981:</span> Debut in Boca</li>
          <li>
            <span>1984:</span> Presentation in Naples.After having played in
            Barcelona -where he did not have a very successful pass- and after a
            first contact with the European soccer, the Ten was presented as a
            new player of Napoli before 80.000 fans who filled the San Paolo
            Stadium in his presentation.
          </li>
          <li><span>1986:</span> Two legendary goals against England.</li>
          <li>
            <span>1986:</span> <strong>Diego and the World Cup</strong> , the
            only one that Diego won, the second in the history of the Argentine
            National Team. Maradona played a huge championship, and took our
            country to the consecration in Mexico. He was the outstanding figure
            of the tournament, with 5 goals, 4 assists and a performance that
            marked him as the King of World Football.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1990:</span> Ankle to misery and runner-up in Italy. Maradona
            played from the third match (vs. Romania) of the World Cup in Italy
            with a broken ankle, given the kicks he suffered. He must have
            infiltrated to play the rest of the competition, although he did not
            stop shining.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1994:</span> Diego's last goal with Argentina. "El grito", was
            Diego's unbridled relief in the foreground of a camera, after
            converting to Greece in the World Cup in the United States.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1994:</span> Positive doping and out of the World Cup. "They
            cut off my legs", that's how Maradona himself described the hardest
            blow of his career after the match against Nigeria. After the 2-1
            victory against the Africans, Diego went through the anti-doping and
            was found to have consumed ephedrine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1994:</span> Debut as a coach.The sanction for doping in the
            U.S. left him off the courts for fifteen months, but far from
            sitting still, the Ten decided to start his career as a DT
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>1996:</span> Return to soccer and Boca. Having also managed
            Racing, Maradona returned to soccer after the suspension. It was
            with 36 years and returning to the club of his loves: Boca. A year
            later, after many ups and downs and without having won any titles,
            Diego announced his retirement from soccer after a Superclásico
            against River.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2001:</span> Farewell party at La Bombonera. Before a stadium
            filled with 60,000 people, Diego had his tribute match in La Boca,
            with luxury guests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2005:</span> More health problems.Diego was on the verge of
            death: he suffered a cardiorespiratory crisis as a result of a
            hypertension condition, which almost cost him his life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2005:</span> Debut as a TV host. After recovering from the
            post-operative process, Diego recovered his silhouette and was
            encouraged to make his first TV strip. It was on La Noche del Diez,
            a program that had 13 episodes and featured luxury guests: Pelé,
            Fidel Castro, Lionel Messi, Zinedine Zidane and Roberto Gómez
            Bolaños, among others. The strip, in which Maradona was seen
            recovering both mentally and physically, was a record audience and a
            great success. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free

          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2008:</span>Debut as DT of Argentine National Team. Diego
            returned to the National Team, but this time as a coach. His first
            game was a friendly against Scotland with a 1-0 win as an away
            player, and for the points on March 28, 2009, in a 4-0 win against
            Venezuela for the 11th date of the South Africa 2010 qualifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>2019:</span> Resurgence and return to Argentine soccer. After
            passing through several clubs in the Middle East and Dorados de
            Sinaloa in Mexico, Gimnasia de La Plata hired him to save the team
            from relegation and was a resurgence for Diego. Maradona returned to
            soccer in our country, he felt again the popular clamor and to be
            himself. That Ten who knew how to make a whole country fall in love,
            who with his mistakes and successes, conquered the world of soccer.
            To have the same sensations of that boy who in his beginnings
            dreamed of playing a World Cup, and who now hopes to be able to keep
            Lobo in the First Division. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator
